WordPress plugin. 

Requires 'User Submitted Posts' plugin to be installed https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-submitted-posts/

Extends 'User Submitted Posts' plugin by adding the uploaded images into the post content and creating the post thumbnail directly after the user submission. 
This make the approval of the user submitted posts easier for the site administrator, cause the images are included into the post editor area instead of a special post field. 
Also the post thumbnail is created directly afte the user submission and not by the 1st post view.
